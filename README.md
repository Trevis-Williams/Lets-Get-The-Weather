## discription 

This website provides a straightforward weather forecast experience. It offers eight default city options that you can easily access by clicking on the respective buttons. Additionally, there's a convenient search bar that allows you to explore weather conditions in various cities worldwide.

One notable feature is that when you click on a city button, the website saves the data to your local storage. This means that the next time you visit the site, it will automatically display the weather information for the last city you were interested in, providing you with a seamless and personalized experience
